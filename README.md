# Mini SciComp Collection
> A (personal) collection of implementations of various _computational science/scientific computing_ concepts and algorithms. Comments/improvements/criticisms are welcome!
This is a part of my self-directed learning journey on various topics in the field of computational science so there will be _**A LOT**_ of mistakes and errors. Please feel free to point them you if you happen to any!
