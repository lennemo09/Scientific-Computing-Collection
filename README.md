# Mini SciComp Collection
A (personal) collection of implementations of various _computational science/scientific computing_ concepts and algorithms. Comments/improvements/criticisms are welcome!
This is a part of my self-directed learning journey on various topics in the field of computational science so there will be _**A LOT**_ of mistakes and errors. Please feel free to point them you if you happen to any!

### Notebooks
All the scripts for this collection is written in Jupyter/IPython notebooks for ease of use and sharing! 
If you are new to Python and/or IPython notebooks, please see the following quick guide on how to get Jupyter installed and running: https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/.

### Contribution
As mentioned above, anyone can make contributions (adding new contents/topics or adding/fixing existing ones), simply put in a PR or contact me via lennemo09@gmail.com.

### Disclaimers
Please be aware of plagiarism policies if you plan to use/reference the code for university assignments or academic works and also it is very likely that I have made (a lot of) mistakes since it is purely written and reviewed by me and no one else.
